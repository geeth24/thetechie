# The Techie

Geeth Gunnampalli (aka. The Techie) is a producer & programmer from Coppell, Texas. He began producing music in 2018 through the help and guidance from his friend Zaen Yenus (aka. ZNO). In 2020, he and ZNO joined TWO14 Sound, an independent record label started by Rith Bhattacharya. This opened up many doors for Techie and he was able to expand his connections by working with various rappers and producers who helped him polish his sound. They gave him feedback and helped him identify loopholes. Techie decided to switch to producing Hip Hop and R&B music after not finding much success with EDM. ZNO had helped him through the transition process and taught Techie how to produce Hip Hop beats. Techie has shown magnificent improvement from his first release in 2018 until now. His debut album is set to drop in 2021.
